# fedora setup

quick setup script for my fedora workstation (https://fedoraproject.org/workstation/)

## what it does

installs all the stuff i need on a fresh fedora install:
- development tools (node, vscode, intellij, webstorm)
- communication apps (discord, telegram, termius)
- entertainment (spotify, steam, parsec)
- utilities (bitwarden, mullvad vpn, htop, fastfetch, lxrandr, obs)
- gaming tools (bottles, lutris, wine, winetricks)
- crypto (exodus wallet)
- and more! too lazy to list look at the src if you care

## how to use

```bash
chmod +x setup.sh
./setup.sh
```

might take a while depending on your internet connection.

## notes

- makes sure flatpak is set up with flathub
- uses native packages where possible
- falls back to flatpak when needed
- should work on fedora 37+

reboot after running to make sure everything loads properly.

# why i made this
my arch linux install died after 2 months, and after trying fedora again on my main system, it's just too good for me to switch back to arch or any other distro. so iâ€™m planning to main fedora long-term, and i made this script in case i ever need to reinstall (nvidia moment?) or set it up on another machine.
